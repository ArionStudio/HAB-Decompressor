# HAB Decompressor

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the HAB Decompressor project! This is a university group project developed in collaboration with [@Banjo7331](https://github.com/Banjo7331). The purpose of this project is to provide a custom Huffman decompressor, specifically designed to work with our custom HAB Compressor, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Banjo7331/Coder_Huffman_in_C). The decompressor is implemented using Java and utilizes JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI).

**Project Overview:**

The HAB Decompressor is a simple GUI application aimed at efficiently decompressing files that have been compressed using our custom Huffman algorithm. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to select and decompress compressed files, allowing them to restore the original content in a quick and straightforward manner.

**Features:**

1. User-Friendly GUI: The HAB Decompressor boasts a clean and user-friendly graphical interface.

2. Custom Huffman Decompression: Our decompressor is specifically tailored to work with files compressed using our custom Huffman algorithm. It utilizes the algorithm's unique compression patterns to effectively restore the original content.
