The Lord of the Rings
BY
J.R.R. Tolkien
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to nd them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly
be celebrating his eleventy-rst birthday with a party of special mag-
nicence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder
of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance
and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his
travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,
whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of
tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,
there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it
seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the
same as at fty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but
unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that
shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it
seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual
youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
